# Arma 3 Playable dog
Heavy WIP, shits buggy, oh no buggy things in arma how ironic.

Left click is bite\
right click is bark\
middle click is some more but more confused barks\
Use ACE interactions on your own and other things\
E and Q do nothing so far, trying to get leaping to work but ~arma's a bitch~ about it\
Other players can interact and pet the doggo because everyone in my unit requested this\
Yes the dog can change tires, I call it a feature
